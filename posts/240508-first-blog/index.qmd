After hemming and hawing on whether to create a blog and which tool to use, here is my first post ðŸ˜„.

I've been finding the following blogs particularly useful: [Aster Hu](https://www.asterhu.com/post/2023-03-30-jekyll-migrating-to-quarto/index.html), [Drew Dimmery](https://ddimmery.com/posts/quarto-website/), and [Danielle Navarro](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/).

I've decided to use Quarto because it seems to be more dynamic than Jekyll (as far as my understanding goes). Syntax highlighting for bash, groovy and R in expandable, copy-able code chunks will be nice for various scripts that I want to post eventually.

I think my first project will be to write my CV using an [rmarkdown template](http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/03/svm-r-markdown-cv/) and share it as a pdf. This blog + CV will meet the minimum requirement for publication on Github pages.
