I trained under [Dr. Fred Dick](https://publish.uwo.ca/~fdick/Lab_Web_Page/index.html) at Western University throughout my undergrad and graduate degrees. We did some interesting work, involving a new mouse strain (created in-house with CRISPR-Cas9), epigenetic silencing of repetitive elements and viral mimicry. Currently, I am looking to profile spatially resolved transcriptomes in fibrosing interstitial lung diseases with [Dr. Marco Mura](https://www.schulich.uwo.ca/respirology//people/faculty/bio-mura.html) also at Western.

## More about me

Despite being Korean, I have both first and middle names. Something to do with a mistake on my first passport application. 'Seung' part is challenging. It's supposed to be as such: <audio controls src="audio/pronunciation.mp3"></audio>.

## Purpose of this blog

I find myself going back to my old code to find some key snippets that I cannot recall. It's a bit of a dumpster dive every time. I hope writing it down here will help me retrieve those easier. This kind of format is apparently called a ["digital garden"](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), but I'm anticipating more of a digital yard waste.

There are some coding "projects" in planning/dev phase that I wouldn't be able to digitally document otherwise.
